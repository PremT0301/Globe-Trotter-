# Testing Shared Trip Functionality

## Current Issue
The shared trip with slug `689a6a0b1e125bce38e9cd97` doesn't exist in the database. This is expected behavior when no trips have been shared yet.

## How to Test Shared Trip Functionality

### Step 1: Create a Trip
1. Go to the application and sign in
2. Navigate to "Create Trip" or "My Trips"
3. Create a new trip with some basic details

### Step 2: Add Activities (Optional)
1. Go to the trip's itinerary builder
2. Add some activities to make the shared trip more interesting
3. Save the itinerary

### Step 3: Share the Trip
1. Go to the trip's itinerary view page
2. Look for the "Share Trip" button (usually near the top)
3. Click "Share Trip" - this will:
   - Generate a unique slug
   - Create a shared trip record in the database
   - Copy the shareable URL to your clipboard
   - Add the trip to the community

### Step 4: Test the Shared Link
1. Open the shared URL in a new browser tab
2. Verify that the trip loads correctly with dynamic day names
3. Test the clone functionality

## Expected Results

After following these steps, you should see:
- ✅ **Dynamic day names** like "Monday, June 15 - Arrival in Paris"
- ✅ **Real trip data** loaded from the database
- ✅ **Proper error handling** if something goes wrong
- ✅ **Clone functionality** working correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:
1. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify backend is running** on port 4000
3. **Check database** for shared trip records
4. **Ensure authentication** is working properly

## Database Verification

You can check if shared trips exist by querying the database:
```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or MongoDB Compass
db.sharedtrips.find()  // Should show shared trip records
db.trips.find()        // Should show trip records
```

## API Endpoints

The key endpoints for shared trips are:
- `POST /api/shared/:tripId` - Share a trip (requires auth)
- `GET /api/shared/u/:slug` - Get shared trip data (public)
- `POST /api/shared/clone/:slug` - Clone a shared trip (requires auth)
